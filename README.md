This application was developed as part of the Openclassrooms iOS development training.
The user interface was entirely programmatically created using CollectionView and TableViews.
I use MVVM architecture.


Techs :
- Observer 
- Coordinator pattern
- Depedencies (Alamofire - Alamofire Image - MarqueeLabel)
- API Edamam


TODO:
- CoreData for fav recipes
- Mock Network
- Unit tests


This is a two pages application :


- Search : on this page the user can add ingredients in a list, using a text field and a button "Add" ; 
           He can clear the igredients list using a "Clear" button ;
           Starts searching for recipes in Edamam's database ;
           The recipes received will be presented in the form of a cell list ;
           The user can tap on a cell recipe and have access to the recipe details :)
           
           
- Favorites : on this page the user will have all his favorite recipes ;
              he can visualise recipe details and change his mind and decide that recipe is no longer favorite by tapping favorit button again ;
              the recipe will be deleted of his favorites list :)
              

TODO:
- Add Favorite button in recipe detail view 
- Implementation of Favorites page
